Solar system model using Three.js

This was meant as a fun challenge for me to learn how to build and edit 3D objects within a website.
Any 3D model can be mapped to the objects within the solar system ie we can make earth into a pickup truck or a coffee mug.

You can find the code for the solar system inside the components folder.
